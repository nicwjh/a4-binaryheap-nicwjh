# A4-BinaryHeap

Your task in this assignment is to implement a Priority Queue using a Maximum Binary Heap. Each element that goes into the Priority Queue is
a Prioritized object that contains a double as its value and a double for its priority. The methods you are filling in 
are those in PriorityQueue.java. Their descriptions are in the Queue interface. You should not be changing any part of the method signatures 
of the methods (return type, parameters, name, etc..) only filling in the methods to implement the heap. You may (and should!) add 
helper methods to complete this assignment.
